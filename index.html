<!-- METHODS USED -->
<p>The National Accelerator Lab, known as SLAC, used beams of X-rays and electrons to uncover the molecular machinery of the coronavirus on an atomic level. In an effort to minimize the risk of infection and comply with social distancing protocols, researchers were able to control robots remotely from their homes to carry out the experiments at the Stanford Synchroton Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) lab. Researchers used X-ray crystallography to produce 3D maps of the where each atom of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is located, aiding in the design of targeted therapeutic interventions. Resarchers at SSRL also used small-angle X-ray scattering to look into how the viral proteins interact with the machinery of the human immune system in order to understand why the virus is so infectious and causes intense inflammation. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a technique involving the use of electron beams, was used at the Stanford-SLAC Cryo-EM Center and the National Center for Macromolecular Imaging to understand how the virus' molecular components interact with drugs or antibodies in their frozen, hydrated state. This technique was essential to determining how to build molecules that can bind and deactivate the RNA.</p>

disease (COVID-19)</a> by Hilla De-Leon</i></p>

<!-- ABSTRACT AND INTRODUCTION -->
<p>This paper discusses the use of a Monte Carlo based algorithm to predict the virus infection rate for different population densities using the most recent epidemic data at the time of its publication (i.e., the nature of the virus). Three different lockdown models and eight various combinations of constraints were used to test the spread of the coronavirus and the efficiency of each model and constraint. After testing three different time-cyclic patterns of no-restriction/lockdown patterns, it was determined that at least ten days of lockdown, social distancing and quarantining symptomatic patients for each time cycle can help control the virus infection. The Monte Carlo Ising model was treated a "one-way" model; a healthy person becomes sick from interacting a sick person (or people). However, that sick person recovers or dies within approximately 14 to 40 days, depending on the severity of the case.
</p>

<!-- PARAMETERIZATION OF THE MODEL -->
<p>The following is a list of parameters and corresponding values that describe the population and the infection's kinetics:<br><br><span class="tab"></span>1. The probability of developing systems over time t, where there was a peak at t = 5 days and a standard deviation of &#963 = 1 day, as described by Gaussian.<br><span class="tab"></span>2. The number of effective households, denoted by N.<br><span class="tab"></span>3. The fraction of "silent carriers" (i.e., asymptomatic) who can infect other people, denoted by <i>a<sub>silent</i></sub>. The probability of transmitting the infection was set to 0.5.<br><span class="tab"></span>4. Each sick person is considered contagious between the third and the seventh day.<br><br>Additionally, each simulation begins with the zero patient, meaning that there is only one infected person. In some of these simulations, the infections come from an unknown source and has not been detected for the first 14 days. This means that there are no restrictions on the population's movements. In other simulations, symptomatic people are forced to maintain a distance of 8 m (i.e., stay at home) after day 14. As a result, the probability of non-household infections are reduced.</p>

<!-- RESULTS -->
<p>The average number of individuals that a single actively infectious person can pass the virus to is denoted by <i>R<sub>0</sub></i>, and the doubling time is denoted by <i>T<sub>d</sub></i>.<br></p>

<!-- RESULTS USING FIGURE 1 -->
<p>The figure above shows the <i>T<sub>d</sub></i> of the percentage of active cases of the total population in the first 14 days as a function of the population density, <i>N</i> (dots). The solid line marks the value of <i>T<sub>d</sub></i> = 2.5 days, corresponding to <i>R<sub>0</sub></i> = 4. This data was directly obtained from the simulation and calculated in the heating phase (there are no restrictions), allowing for a calibration of the model to encompass the intrinsic features of the disease.</p>

<p></p>

<!-- RESULTS USING FIGURE 2 -->
<p>Starting with the zero patient, each case ran 100 times. Different results were expected in each run because the Monte Carlo algorithm is based on random numbers. The number of runs evaluated the robustness of the algorithm. The figure above presents the numerical results of the percentage of active cases of the total population of infected cases, with panels (a) and (b) being results from known source, while panels (c) and (d) being results from unknown sources. Panels (b) and (d) are for the case where there are strict social distancing protocols were imposed on sick, symptomatic people (8 m). For all panels, the solid (dotted) line is model 1 with (without) moderate social distancing, the long (short) dashed line is mode 2 with (without) moderate social distancing, and the long (short) dotted-dashed line is model 3 with (without) moderate social distancing. The first day of lockdown (day 15) is marked by the dashed vertical line. The errorbars in panel (a) were originated from the simulation's rmsd, computed from 100 different samples generated to compute each curve. The curves in the other panels omit the errorbars to improve their readability.</p>

<p>This data supports the effectiveness of controlling the spread of the coronavirus with forced lockdowns. The simulations found that forcing a lockdown after 14 days from the first case controls the spread of the coronavirus in a way that the peak number of cases occurs on day 24, while the rate of increasing cases decreases after day 15. Additionally, since the average time for recovery is 14 days and the typical infection period ranges from the third day until the seventh day, the decreasing rate of the number of active cases during the lockdown is much slower than the increasing rate of the number of active cases without restrictions. Based on these findings, the paper concludes that it takes longer than 14 days of lockdown to reduce the number of active cases in a given population.</p>

<!-- RESULTS USING FIGURE 3 -->
<p>The figure above is an inset of panel (c) of the previous figure. It does not take into account required social distancing and lockdowns. As such, it can observed that there is an increase in infected cases when there is a lack of restrictions imposed on a population. </p>

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
<p>The Monte Carlo algorithm was able to model various scenarios of infection rate. The parameter <i>R<sub>0</sub></i> was obtained from the simulation and not pre-assumed and used as a way to tune up the other parameters better on the post-processing of clinical and epidemiological data. This paper concludes that its ability to simulate different lockdown patterns and scenarios proves the need for physical and mathematical models to avoid large infection rates of epidemics. From the physical point of view, the paper also concludes that lowering an area's infection rate can be done by strictly imposing social distancing regulations and reducing high concentrations of people on a daily basis.</p>

Radiation-Induced Inactivation for Vaccine Development</a> by Ziad Francis, Sebastien Incerti, Sara A. Zein,
Nathanael Lampe, Carlos A. Guzman and Marco Durante</i></p>

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<p>
New radiation techniques have been considered impractical when it comes to the development of vaccines. They have been considered to be too expensive and inaccessible. Moreover, the high-dose of gamma (&#947) rays damages the epitopes necessary to elicit the immmune response. However, the success of irradiated vaccine development for human malaria and influenza has prompted research into the application of virus irradiation on COVID-19. This study utilizes the Monte Carlo toolkit Geant4-DNA to simulate the virus's structure and calculate the damage to its spike and membrane proteins. The simulation also shows the effects of exposing low- or high-linear energy-transfer (LET) radiation onto the RNA, where high-LET radiation is more densely ionizing than low-LET radiation and therefore causes less damage to the membrane during virus irradiation.
</p>

<!-- RESULTS OF FIGURE 2 -->
<p>
The figure above shows the distribution of the number of damage events done on the RNA and damaged spike proteins for particles and &#947 electrons, normalized per 1 eV of energy deposition. Considering the damage to these essential components of the virus was essential to developing the vaccine. The study found that having a dense ionizing track led to more proteins being damaged.
</p>

<!-- RATIO OF PROTEIN/RNA DAMAGE -->
<p>
Based on the calculated survial curves, the study concluded that the virus could be inactivated by merely breaking a single RNA strand due to its lack of ability of be repaired. As a result, the amino acid chain is interrupted. Further, it is essential for there to be a high dose of high-LET radiation in order to inactivate the virus. The dose is proportional to the LET and the particle fluence must be able to hit all the targets, thus requiring the dose to be high.
</p>

<!-- DISCUSSION -->
<p>
The Monte Carlo simulations from this study have shown the success of heavy ion accelerators for vaccine development. Inactivating the virus via this technique minimizes the damage to the epitopes in membrane proteins. Though this method is impracticle and expensive, the experimental data from this work could be undertaken to develop more efficient and cost-effective technologies for collecting large quantities of high-LET radiation-inactivated viruses.

Connected Medical Sensors and Computational Grids</a> by Philippe Gavillet, Bernard M. Marechal and Diego Carvalho
</i></p>

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<p>
The COVID-19 pandemic presented issues with comprehensive monitoring of the disease, as there was a lack of medical data of patients and the real-time decision-making was slow. This study proposes a solution to making the acquistion of patient data more accesible and available as experiemntal data for epidemiological research with the cooperation of e-medicine specialists and experts in connected medical sensors from institutions like CERN.
</p>

<!-- STUDY OF THE PANDEMIC REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT -->
<p>
It is essential to sufficiently share data and studies between hospital servers. The support and collaboration with HEP sectors and CERN is well-suited for the fight against COVID-19. They have scientific data analysis platforms, such as Root, that could be installed and customized in hospitals and research centers. Providing such technologies creates a widespread distribution not only of patient data, but also of epidemic characteristics. The coordination of the networking of hospital servers through the medical server's network would include the need to upload new measurement parameters on the sensors of the targeted population. This effective flow of information and statistics of the pandemic properties will greatly impact the sociopolitical decisions in the given region.
</p>

<!-- THE COMPUATIONAL GRID FOR EPIDEMOLOGICAL PREDICTIONS -->
<p>
This project is expected to be able to create a large-statistic pandemic database consisting of patient data sets covering several regions. Using Monte Carlo simulation methods, the characteristics of the pandemic can be induced and its evolution can be predicted. The simulation is dependent on various parameters, including health status, age, etc. in order to understand the effect of them in individual contamination and in the infection propagation. In addition to the parameters, there must be high statistics computations and recurring huge computing power.
</p>

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
<p>
The solution claims to provide earlier diagnostics for prompt treatments and hospitalizations, statistical analyses for the evolution of the pandemic, and data to corroborate epidemiological model predictions. This can be done with the coopration between medical sector institutions, medical sensors starts ups and the HEP community.

<p><i>The fight against COVID-19: Running Folding@Home simulations on ATLAS resources</a> by Alessandra Forti, Ivan Glushkov, Lukas Heinrich, Mario Lassnig, David South and Rodney Walker</i></p>

<!-- THE FOLDING@HOME PROJECT -->
<p>
Folding@Home was a computational project developed at CERN 	to investigate the molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2 and to perform protein folding simulations in order to help medical and pharmaceutical professionals to develop effective drugs not just against COVID-19, but against a variety of diseases. The system has grown from running applications with low priority on volunteer personal computers to larger resources. The software has a client-server architecture containing the FAHCLIENT, which downloads the work, checkpoints and uploads the results to the servers. 
</p>

<!-- CONTAINERISATION OF THE CLIENTS -->
<p>
The software distribution uses the read-only filesystem CVMFS, and the standardised workflows exist to make HEP software like the ATLAS Reconstruction and Analysis releases available on it. It is based on Linux container images to allow users and production operators to easily specify full root-filesystems as the execution environment of the workload. This allows the workload to avoid the need to match or test to work on the existing operating system of the compute elements within the grid resources. It can also distribute software targeted to run on GPU-enabled queues within ATLAS, making the containers more suitable for new, non-HEP workloads, such as molecular biology simulation.
</p>


<!-- CONCLUSION -->
LHC experiments were able to quickly respond to the pandemic by donating its resources to the external volunteer computing project. The ATLAS experiment led the daily individual contributors of the project at large. The scientific data generated by the workloads are now managed by the Rucio data management software.

<!-- SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION -->
<p>
In the fight against COVID-19, CERN developed CARA, the COVID-19 Airbourne Risk Assessment tool. This tool was designed to model the concentration of viruses in enclosed spaces using clear and intuitive graphs. A variety of parameters could be used to produce such graphs, including room volume, exposure time, activity type, mask-wearing and verntilation. This helps in making informed decision-making and assess risk levels in given areas. The limiting factor of this tool is that it only estimates the impact of long-range airborne transmission, not short distances. Nevertheless, users will be able to adapt to different settings and make more informed decisions in order to reduce the probability of infection. The Summer Student Project at CERN created a mobile and desktop application based on the pre-existing CARA web page.

<!-- EXPLAINING CARA GRAPH -->
<p>
The graph above is an example of the CERN's CARA tool being put to use. It models the concentration profile of viruses in air over the course of the working day, including a one-hour lunch break. By comparing the area below each graph, it can be concluded that there is a higher chance of being infected when placed in a larger area.

<!-- SUMMARY -->
<p>
Chest computed tomography (CT) can identify if patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, with radiologic hallmarks including bilateral, peripheral ground-glass tomography (GGOs) and conslidation. Cone beam comuputed tomography (CBCT) is used on cancer patients undergoing RT. This study reviews CBCT scans of initially asymptomatic patients undergoing image-guided RT for breast cancer who eventually developed COVID-19 symptoms.

<p>In the left panel of figure 3, the CBCT scans shows bilateral peripheral GGOs the 13th day after symptom onset. In the right panel, it can be observed that the GGOs were diminishing the 16th day after symptom onset.</p>

<p>Cancer patients are especially susceptible to risk of infection to COVID-19, along with its symptoms. As such, it is essential for these types of patients to be diagnosed and treated with radiographic imaging. Further, familitarity with CT changes of COVID-19 pneumonitis allows for earlier detection in cancer patients undergoing CBCT for RT treatment. Thus, this will disseminate the risk of COVID-19 infection.</p>

<!-- EXPLANATION -->
The scans in all four cases presented similarlities; all cases shared similar characteristics such that they had multiple FDG-positive GGOS and FDG-avid lymph nodes in their lungs. In addition to the scans, the patients reportedly had similar characteristics to that of COVID-19 symptoms, including fever, soar throat, dry cough, respiratory infections, etc. Although the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test was not performed on the patients, the study was able to find consistency with a diagnosis of COVID-19. This study has demonstrated that F-FDG PET/CT scanners can play a diagnostic role in COVID-19, especially during the early stages of the infection. Though it is not generaly recommended for testing for infections diseases, scanning can be used as a complement to testing by confirming the existence of the disease in a patient, especially when there are high rates of false-negative findings.
